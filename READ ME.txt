Rimstar is a text-based RPG im currently making.

To run the game, you need to run the batch file.

Also, you might notice there are text files in there. those are the individual saves for each character. Note that you could edit
them, but you might either ruin it (if you don't know what your doing), or just end up cheating.

If the game doesn't run, you will need to download python for it to work (don't download version 2, or it won't work)

Have Fun Playing! :)
